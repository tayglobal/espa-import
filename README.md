# Remote Import


## Introduction

Purpose of this module is to change Pythonâ€™s import hooks from purely loading from local filesystem to loading some from remote system.
This makes it easy to rapidly test experimental code on compute clusters or quickly share and debug code form teammates.
The loading of remote source would be built on top of :ref:`kydb-page-ref`.


## Example

Create */tmp/hello.py*

```python

def greet():
     print("Hello World!")
         
```

Upload it to remote source

```
python -m epimport.uploader --srcdb=redis://my-redis.host/my-source --key=hello.py /tmp/hello.py
```
    
Now we can import the *hello* module::

```python
import epimport as ei
ei.set_srcdb('redis://my-redis.host/my-source')

import hello

hello.greet() # prints 'Hello Word!'
```
